    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A perfect deviled egg is the ideal party appetizer. This recipe walks you through how to perfectly hard boil an egg, how to make the filling, and what toppings go best on a deviled egg.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>6cups water</li>
        <li>2tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4tsp salt</li>
        <li>1tsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>smoked paprika, to taste</li>
        <li>chopped green onions (optional)</li>
        <li>1tsp baking soda (for easier peeling; optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your 6 eggs in a large saucepan and cover completely with water, so that there is about an inch of water over the eggs (usually about 6 cups)</li>
        <li>Add the baking soda to the water, if using. Baking soda makes the eggs easier to peel once they are done boiling, but is not necessary. If possible, use eggs that are over a week old. Week-old eggs peel very easily.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to boil. Once it begins boiling, immediately turn off the heat and cover.</li>
        <li>Leave the eggs in the water on the warm stovetop for 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare an ice water bath for the eggs.</li>
        <li>When the 11 minutes is up, transfer the eggs promptly to the ice bath to cool, and leave them in for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cool to the touch, remove from the bath and peel. I recommend knocking the eggs on your countertop so that they are cracked all around before peeling.</li>
        <li>Once you have peeled the eggs, cut each egg in half and scoop out the yolk using a spoon and your fingers. Put the yolks in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the mayonnaise, salt, and dijon mustard to the yolks, and mash together until a smooth, creamy consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>Spoon the yolk mixture into each half of the egg, doing your best to divide the mixture evenly between all the eggs.</li>
        <li>Top the eggs with paprika and green onions, or enjoy plain.</li>
    </ol>
