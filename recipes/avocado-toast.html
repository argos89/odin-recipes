    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Multigrain bread topped with fresh avocado, a fried egg, and an assortment of toppings make for the ultimate nutritious breakfast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 or 2 slices Dave's Killer Bread (21 grain variety; I recommend two slices if you buy the thin-sliced bag)</li>
        <li>1tbsp olive oil, if frying your egg (can be subbed with butter)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, fried</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 whole ripe avocado</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>red hot pepper flakes, to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Put your bread in the toaster. I like to have the bread ready to toast, but I usually don't start toasting it until the egg is halfway cooked.</li>
        <li>In a small frying pan, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat</li>
        <li>Once the oil is shimmering, crack your egg into the pan. Cook to your liking. Begin toasting the bread halfway through cooking your egg.</li>
        <li>While egg is frying, cut open your avocado</li>
        <li>Remove fying pan from heat and bread from toaster. Spread avocado over your toast. If you are using two slices of bread, I recommend using 1/2 the avocado per slice. For one slice of bread, use just 1/2 the avocado.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper the avocado, to taste, and add red pepper flakes if using.</li>
        <li>Top the avocado with your egg, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
